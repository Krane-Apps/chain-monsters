# How to Play Game

1. **Game Setup:**

   - Each player starts with four characters, one from each clan: Goblin, Golem, Angel, and Minotaur.
   - The game grid is a 5x8 layout.
   - Characters are initially placed at the edge of the grid.

2. **Movement:**

   - Players take turns moving their characters.
   - Characters can move one block in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right) if the block is empty.

3. **Attacking:**

   - Characters can attack adjacent enemies (any of the four directions).
   - Attacking increases the character's mana.
   - The attacked enemy's health decreases.

4. **Mana and Health:**

   - Normal attack: Decreases enemy health by 25%.
   - Heavy attack (when mana is full): Decreases adjacent enemy health by 50%.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - The last player with characters remaining on the grid wins the game.

# Blockchain Part

1. **Grid Creation:**

   - At the start of the game, the blockchain creates a grid representing all 8 monsters and their initial health and mana.
   - This grid ensures the state of each monster is transparently recorded and maintained.

2. **In-Game Assets (OPTIONAL):**

   - Monsters and special items can be tokenized as NFTs, allowing for true ownership and trading.

3. **Game Movements:**

   - Each move, attack, and game action is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain.
   - The blockchain ensures transparency and immutability of game actions and returns updated grid values to the frontend.

4. **Health Deduction:**

   - The blockchain calculates health deductions based on the type of attack (normal or heavy). If the attack is heavy (mana used), the respective monsterâ€™s mana becomes zero.
   - Damage is recorded and deducted from the target monster's health accordingly.

5. **Rewards:**

   - Players earn cryptocurrency/NFT rewards for victories and achievements, ensuring transparent and secure transactions.

6. **Leaderboard Maintenance:**
   - The blockchain updates the leaderboard based on match outcomes and total damage dealt.
